# 🛠️ PInit

**PInit** (short for **Project Initializer**) is your go-to CLI for bootstrapping new projects across popular frameworks — fast, consistent, and production-ready.

### ✨ Features

- 🚀 One-line setup for:

  - `react+vite`
  - `nextjs`
  - `fastapi`
  - `django`
  - `django-rest-framework`
  - plain `python`

- 🧹 Pre-configured:

  - Linters & formatters (`prettier`, `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, etc.)
  - `pre-commit` hooks
  - `commitizen` for conventional commits

- 🐳 Starter Dockerfiles for web projects
- 📄 Auto-generated README, license, config files
- 🧰 Uses `pnpm` for JS/TS, `uv` for Python

### 🧪 Why?

Starting new projects sucks when you repeat the same boilerplate steps. PInit automates all of that — without skipping on best practices.

### 🏁 Usage

```bash
./pinit.sh
```

(Coming soon: interactive menu like `create-next-app`!)
